My Bakery API
Here is a documentation for the Bakery Waldo App.

What the project does?
A: The Bakery Waldo is created to allow users to search for bakeries around the Greater Toronto Area.

Why the project is useful?
A: The app is a simple and straightforward! Enter in a city name (GTA cities only for now) and a set of information pertaining the bakery renders.

How users can get started with the project?
A: There are two ways to get started with this project:
    1) Create your own online database and insert data.
    2) Find a bakery API.
Once you select one of the methods above, simply fetch the data and append the fetched data onto your html file.
It is difficult to explain all of the steps through this brief documentation but I encourage you to look through my files and avail yourself or API tutorials on Youtube.com!

Where users can get help with your project?
A: Like I mentioned above, youtube is my prime resource for completing this project.

Who maintains and contributes to the project?
A: Just me for now :)
